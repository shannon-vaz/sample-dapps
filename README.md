# Sample DApps

These are sample DApps created while learning an Ethereum/Solidity course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)  
authored by Stephen Grider.

Dev environment uses a barebones setup. No frameworks like truffle or hardhat are used.

Contracts were tested on Rinkeby testnet. Any contract addresses found in the  
files will be of the contract deployed on Rinkeby.
